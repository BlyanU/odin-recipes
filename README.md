What I learned:
I have learned many things during this project. In this project, I am able to link pages using both relative and absolute paths. Another element I use a lot are the unordered and ordered lists. I have also learned when to use other heading. By using the h1 for the title of the entire page and h2 and h3 for sub titles.

Challenges:
During this project I had trouble figuring out when to commit. When I commit, I am always left wondering if I am committing too frequently. Another challenge I faced involves commenting every commit. When I comment for every commit, I do not know whether I am being too descriptive and too vague. This applies to naming my files as well. I do not know whether my files are too descriptive and long or vague. Besides the comment and file names, I had trouble resizing the images as they would stretch if I were to do so.
