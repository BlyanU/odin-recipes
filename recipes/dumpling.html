  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>This recipe includes a combination of Chinese pork and celery. This combination is common in China and is easy to
  make. Chinese celery, also known as leaf celer, is one of the main ingredients in this dish. What differentiates
  this celery from standard celery is its stronger celery flavor. Its stems are thinner and less crunchy and generally have more leaves.</p>
