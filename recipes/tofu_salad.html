  <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This tofu avocado salad is a no-cook, vegan, healthy recipe with a tangy Asian dressing that can be customized to your liking! Quick recipes like this tofu avocado salad are quick and easy, and require no cooking at all! Not to mention the fact that itâ€™s healthy (with protein and healthy fats) and can easily be made totally vegan. I love it as a side dish, or as a light meal with steamed rice.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>7 ounces silken tofu</li>
      <li>1 ripe avocado</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ginger</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons light soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon Chinese black vinegar</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon white pepper</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons water</li>
      <li>salt</li>
      <li>1 scallion</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
    
    <ol>

      <li>Start by thinly slicing your silken tofu into small squares. Also cut your avocado in half. Thinly slice it crosswise so you get pieces similarly sized to the tofu slices. Arrange alternating slices of silken tofu and avocado on a serving platter. </li>

      <li>In a small bowl, combine the minced garlic and ginger, soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, vinegar, white pepper, water, and salt to taste. Mix well to combine, and drizzle over the tofu and avocado. </li>

      <li>Garnish with chopped scallions and serve. </li>
      
    </ol>
